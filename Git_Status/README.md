# Git Porcelain

- In Git, _`--porcelain`_  option command is a high-level commands that are user-friendly and intended for end users. They provide a convenient interface to the underlying "plumbing" commands, which are low-level and more complex.

- The command _`git status --porcelain`_ provides a simplified, machine-readable output of the current status of your Git repository. This format is particularly useful for scripts or automation because it presents the information in a concise manner.
  
- Porcelain Format: The output is structured so that each line corresponds to a file, with two-letter status codes indicating the state of each file (e.g., modified, staged, untracked).

- Use Cases: This command is often used in scripts or when you need to parse the status information programmatically without the additional text and formatting provided by the standard git status command.

```sh
M file1.txt
?? file2.txt
```

- Here, `M` indicates that file1.txt has been modified, and `??` indicates that file2.txt is untracked

## Usage Context

- Porcelain commands are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making them suitable for everyday tasks in Git. They abstract away the complexity of the underlying plumbing commands, which handle the actual data manipulation.
